## for designers

- The best form validation offers feedback on each individual field, as well as a feedback summary on the entire form.

- The most legible font-size is between 14px and 16px, with line heights from 1.1em to 1.5em depending on line length and font-size.

- Create a favicon at 260x260, which can be sized down to the various formats. Also supply a flat shape vector version (black SVG on transparent background).

- Create structural layouts at a wide array of sizes (ie. 320, 480, 768, 1024, 1280, 1920). Then create any specific comps at the most popular extremes (320, 1280).

- design patterns (toasts vs alerts, when to use modals)
  - radio/checkbox/ddl (NNgroup article)
