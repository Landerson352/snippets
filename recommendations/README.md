## for designers

- The best form validation offers feedback on each individual field, as well as a feedback summary on the entire form.

- The most legible font-size is between 14px and 16px, with line heights from 1.1em to 1.5em depending on line length and font-size.

- The largest favicon to account for is 260x260. Also supply a flat shape vector version (black SVG on transparent background).

- breakpoints (and/or canvas sizes to design for)

- design patterns (toasts vs alerts, when to use modals)
  - radio/checkbox/ddl (NNgroup article)
